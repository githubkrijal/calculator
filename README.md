<h2 align="left">Introduction</h2>
This is a simple calculator that I have made using python. I have used tkinter libaray to make it interface. This calculator can perform different mathemathical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percentage and also can perform decimal operation. This calculator can take multiple operators too. If user enters operator incorrectly it shows 'ERROR'.
